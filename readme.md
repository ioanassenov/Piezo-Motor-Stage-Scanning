# Piezo Inertial Drive Stage Scanning Autosequences

This repository contains MATLAB code autosequences used to control the Piezoelectric Inertial Drive Stages
made by Thorlabs.

##### Repository File Structure
- `KIM101_GUIDE.m` This is the original code provided by Thorlabs to demonstrate MATLAB implementation of the API
- `IDS_Scanning.m` This file contains the main autosequence that scans across the surface of a stage in an XY configuration
- `testing.m`      A sandbox file for testing purposes
- `Documentation/` This directory has documentation PDFs from Thorlabs about the relevant components.
